 <p>  You can find below my RPG creation (in French). The first one is <u> Fruits et Légumes</u> (Fruit and Vegetables).
 It's an amateur RPG free to download, share and modify. The abstract of this RPG is to play a fruit or a vegetable into a supermarket, where two kingdoms are in war. This RPG is made to improvise a party when you don't have time to create a full set of scenarios or when your are faced to new players.
 Indeed this RPG is three pages long with a description of the universe and the game system. You can find just below the character sheet. Enjoy</p>
